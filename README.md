# Class Repo Updater

This is a command line tool that can be used to update class content repos for the EdX fullstack web development course.

## Disclaimer

The project currently requires the following folder structure:

- `class-content-sync-tool`
- `fullstack-ground` (curriculum repo)
- `<class-name>` (class repo)

with the class name needing to be updated in the source code
